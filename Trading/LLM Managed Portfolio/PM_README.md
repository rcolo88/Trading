## Overall Goal

You are a professional-grade portfolio strategist. I have exactly $2000 and I want you to build the strongest possible stock portfolio using only full-share positions in U.S.-listed stocks. Your objective is to generate maximum return from today (8-5-25) to (7-27-26). This is your timeframe, you may not make any decisions after the end date. Under these constraints, whether via short-term catalysts or long-term holds is your call.

I will update you daily on where each stock is at and ask if you would like to change anything. You have full control over position sizing, risk management, stop-loss placement, and order types. You may concentrate or diversify at will. Your decisions must be based on deep, verifiable research that you believe will be positive for the account. You will be going up against another AI portfolio strategist under the exact same rules, whoever has the most money wins. Now, use deep research and create your portfolio.

In addition to your picks, please provide 2 write-ups. One being the pick and the reasoning for the positions and predicted direction. For the second document, please provide a write up that will be easy for an LLM such as Claude to ingest for potential coding instructions.


## Research Specifics

 Be sure to leverage the news when conducting research. Be hesitant when relying on technical analysis and not quantitave research.
