## üèõÔ∏è 80/20 PORTFOLIO FRAMEWORK

### **80% Core Holdings Criteria (Quality-Focused)**
**Target Companies: High-Quality Compounders with Sustainable Competitive Advantages**

**QUALITY METRICS (Primary Screen - Academic-Backed):**
Based on extensive academic research showing quality factors outperform value alone:

1. **Profitability Excellence (REQUIRED for Core):**
   - Gross Profitability (Revenue - COGS / Assets) > 40%
   - ROE consistently > 15% for 3+ years
   - Operating margins stable or expanding
   - ROIC > 15% (demonstrates efficient capital allocation)
   - Free Cash Flow positive and growing
   - Operating Cash Flow > Net Income (quality earnings signal)

2. **Earnings Quality Signals:**
   - Low accruals ratio (earnings backed by cash, not accounting)
   - Operating cash flow exceeds net income consistently
   - Consistent earnings without excessive one-time items
   - Limited working capital expansion relative to sales growth
   - Clean accounting with minimal adjustments

3. **Conservative Growth Profile:**
   - Asset growth < 20% annually (aggressive expansion = red flag per academic research)
   - Organic growth prioritized over acquisitive growth
   - Disciplined capital allocation with clear ROIC hurdles
   - Strong balance sheet (Debt/EBITDA < 3x)
   - Sustainable competitive advantages (network effects, brand, scale, IP)

4. **Quality Score Calculation:**
   Rate each company 1-10 on:
   - Gross profitability score (weight: 30%)
   - ROE persistence score (weight: 25%)
   - Earnings quality score (weight: 25%)
   - Conservative growth score (weight: 20%)
   - **Combined Quality Score > 7 required for core position**
   - **Quality Score > 8 allows premium valuations up to 30x P/E**

**VALUATION (Secondary Screen):**
Quality companies can appear expensive but still outperform:
- P/E acceptable up to 30x if quality score > 8
- Use multiple valuation metrics together (P/E, P/FCF, EV/EBITDA, PEG)
- Compare to sector averages and historical ranges, not absolute levels
- Free cash flow yield > 3% preferred but not required for highest quality

**POSITION SIZING BY QUALITY:**
- Quality Score 9-10: 10-20% position size
- Quality Score 8-8.9: 7-12% position size
- Quality Score 7-7.9: 5-8% position size
- Below 7: Exit or don't enter

**Core Holdings Philosophy:**
- These are "sleep well at night" positions backed by academic research
- Hold through normal market volatility
- Only exit if quality score drops below 7 or egregious overvaluation (>40x P/E)
- Target 7-12 total core positions for appropriate diversification

### **20% Opportunistic Holdings - Thematic Discovery Process**

**STEP 1: DYNAMIC THEME IDENTIFICATION**
The LLM should first identify the most promising investment themes by:

1. **Scan Current Market Catalysts:**
   - Regulatory changes (IRA, CHIPS Act, infrastructure bills, defense spending)
   - Technology disruptions (AI adoption, quantum computing, robotics)
   - Demographic shifts (aging population, urbanization, remote work)
   - Geopolitical events (reshoring, energy security, supply chain shifts)
   - Corporate spending priorities (AI infrastructure, cybersecurity, cloud)

2. **Select Top 2-3 Themes Based On:**
   - Catalyst strength (government backing, corporate necessity, secular trend)
   - Timeline alignment (12-18 month acceleration expected)
   - Market size ($10B+ TAM with <20% current penetration)
   - Clear beneficiaries identifiable (pure-plays available)
   - Multiple demand drivers reducing single-point-of-failure risk

**STEP 2: THEMATIC COMPANY SCORING**
For each theme selected, identify companies and score:

**Theme Alignment (1-10):** How directly does the company benefit?
- 8-10: Pure-play, primary business aligned with theme
- 5-7: Significant exposure, diversified business
- 1-4: Tangential exposure only

**Market Timing (1-10):** Where in the adoption curve?
- 8-10: Inflection point imminent (6-12 months)
- 5-7: Early adoption phase (12-24 months)
- 1-4: Conceptual or very early stage

**Competitive Position (1-10):** Category leadership potential?
- 8-10: Clear leader or uniquely positioned
- 5-7: Strong player with differentiation
- 1-4: Undifferentiated or subscale

**Execution Capability (1-10):** Can they capture the opportunity?
- 8-10: Proven team, strong balance sheet, partnerships in place
- 5-7: Capable team, adequate resources
- 1-4: Questionable execution, resource constraints

**MINIMUM THEMATIC SCORE: 28/40 for inclusion**

**STEP 3: POSITION SIZING BY CONVICTION**
- Total Score 35-40: 5-7% position (maximum for opportunistic)
- Total Score 30-34: 3-5% position
- Total Score 28-29: 2-3% position
- Below 28: Do not invest

**Priority Themes to Evaluate:**
- AI Infrastructure (data centers, cooling, power, networking)
- Nuclear Renaissance (SMRs, uranium, services)
- Defense Modernization (drones, cyber, space, hypersonics)
- Longevity/GLP-1 Revolution (biotech, medical devices)
- Automation/Robotics (manufacturing, logistics, services)
- Climate Adaptation (infrastructure, materials, technology)
- Quantum Computing (hardware, software, security)

**Opportunistic Holdings Rules:**
- Maximum 20% total allocation (can be 15-18% if limited opportunities)
- Individual position maximum: 7%
- **Cash flow negative is acceptable** IF runway > 12 months and revenue growing > 50%
- **Limited analyst coverage is acceptable** for small-caps with strong themes
- Set stricter stop-losses (-25% to -30%) due to higher volatility
- Take profits more aggressively (+40-60% gains)

## üìö INTEGRATED RESEARCH WORKFLOW

### **For Core Holdings (80%):**
1. **Quality Screen First:** Calculate quality scores using profitability metrics
2. **Competitive Analysis:** Verify sustainable moat and market position
3. **Analyst Overlay:** Check institutional support (not primary driver)
4. **Valuation Context:** Accept premium valuations for quality (up to 30x if score > 8)
5. **Position Size:** Scale with quality score (higher quality = larger position)

### **For Opportunistic Holdings (20%):**
1. **Theme Discovery:** Identify 2-3 mega-trends with near-term catalysts
2. **Company Mapping:** Find pure-plays and picks-and-shovels providers
3. **Thematic Scoring:** Rate each on 4 dimensions (minimum 28/40)
4. **Risk Calibration:** Smaller positions, tighter stops for lower scores
5. **Catalyst Timeline:** Map specific events over next 12-18 months

### **Weekly Review Process:**
- **Monday:** Scan for new themes and catalysts using news and research
- **Tuesday:** Score existing positions on quality/thematic metrics
- **Wednesday:** Identify rebalancing needs based on score changes
- **Thursday:** Deep research on new candidates
- **Friday:** Prepare and format trade recommendations
