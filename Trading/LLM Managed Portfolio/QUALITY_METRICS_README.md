## 🎓 The Five Quality Metrics

### 1. Gross Profitability (25% weight)
**Formula:** `(Revenue - COGS) / Total Assets`
- Measures pricing power and operational efficiency
- Academic basis: Novy-Marx (2013)
- Excellent: ≥45%, Good: 35-44%, Average: 25-34%, Poor: <25%

### 2. Return on Equity - ROE (20% weight)
**Formula:** `Net Income / Shareholder Equity`
- Measures capital efficiency and returns to shareholders
- Academic basis: DuPont analysis framework
- Excellent: ≥25%, Good: 18-24%, Average: 12-17%, Poor: <12%

### 3. Operating Profitability (20% weight)
**Formula:** `(Revenue - COGS - SG&A) / Total Assets`
- Measures operational efficiency excluding financing effects
- Academic basis: Ball et al. (2015)
- Excellent: ≥30%, Good: 20-29%, Average: 10-19%, Poor: <10%

### 4. Free Cash Flow Yield (20% weight)
**Formula:** `Free Cash Flow / Market Cap`
- Measures valuation and cash generation quality
- Academic basis: Piotroski (2000) F-Score
- Excellent: ≥8%, Good: 5-7%, Average: 3-4%, Poor: <3%

### 5. Return on Invested Capital - ROIC (15% weight)
**Formula:** `NOPAT / (Total Debt + Total Equity)`
- Measures true economic profitability
- Academic basis: Economic Value Added (EVA) framework
- Excellent: ≥20%, Good: 15-19%, Average: 10-14%, Poor: <10%

## 🏆 Quality Tier Classification

| Tier | Score Range | Characteristics | Investment Approach |
|------|-------------|----------------|---------------------|
| **Elite** | 85-100 | Exceptional quality, strong moats, pricing power | Core long-term holdings |
| **Strong** | 70-84 | High quality, sustainable business model | Attractive for growth strategies |
| **Moderate** | 50-69 | Average quality, some competitive strengths | Selective, situation-dependent |
| **Weak** | 0-49 | Below-average quality, concerning fundamentals | Generally avoid |

## ⚠️ Red Flag Detection

The system automatically detects six types of red flags:

1. **High Accruals** (>5% of assets) - Aggressive accounting, unsustainable earnings
2. **Excessive Asset Growth** (>20% YoY) - Overexpansion, integration challenges
3. **Deteriorating Margins** (>-3% YoY) - Competitive pressure, operational issues
4. **High Leverage** (D/E >2.0x) - Financial risk, interest burden
5. **Negative Free Cash Flow** - Cash burn, liquidity concerns
6. **Negative ROE** - Value destruction, poor capital allocation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Basic Usage

```python
from quality_metrics_calculator import QualityMetricsCalculator

# Initialize
calculator = QualityMetricsCalculator()

# Prepare financial data
company_data = {
    'ticker': 'AAPL',
    'revenue': 394_328_000_000,
    'cogs': 223_546_000_000,
    'sga': 26_094_000_000,
    'total_assets': 352_755_000_000,
    'net_income': 99_803_000_000,
    'shareholder_equity': 62_146_000_000,
    'free_cash_flow': 111_443_000_000,
    'market_cap': 3_000_000_000_000,
    'total_debt': 111_088_000_000,
    'nopat': 85_000_000_000,
}

# Calculate quality metrics
result = calculator.calculate_quality_metrics(company_data)

# Access results
print(f"Score: {result.composite_score}/100")
print(f"Tier: {result.tier.value}")
print(f"Red Flags: {len(result.red_flags)}")
```

### Integration with yfinance

```python
from example_quality_integration import QualityScreener

# Initialize screener
screener = QualityScreener()

# Analyze single stock (fetches data automatically)
result = screener.analyze_stock('AAPL')
print(result.summary)

# Screen entire portfolio
portfolio = ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'NVDA']
report = screener.generate_portfolio_quality_report(portfolio)
print(report)
```

```bash
python "Portfolio Scripts Schwab/test_quality_metrics.py"
```

**Expected Output:**

## 💡 Integration with Your Trading System

### Option 1: Quality Filter for Portfolio

Add quality screening before HuggingFace recommendations:

```python
from quality_metrics_calculator import QualityMetricsCalculator, QualityTier

def quality_filter_portfolio(holdings):
    """Filter out low-quality holdings."""
    calculator = QualityMetricsCalculator()

    high_quality = []
    concerns = []

    for ticker, position in holdings.items():
        # Fetch data and calculate quality
        financial_data = fetch_data(ticker)
        result = calculator.calculate_quality_metrics(financial_data)

        if result.tier in [QualityTier.ELITE, QualityTier.STRONG]:
            if not any(rf.severity == "HIGH" for rf in result.red_flags):
                high_quality.append(ticker)
        else:
            concerns.append((ticker, result))

    return high_quality, concerns
```

### Option 2: Enhanced Trade Recommendations

Incorporate quality scores into trading decisions:

```python
def generate_trade_with_quality(ticker, action, shares):
    """Generate trade recommendation with quality assessment."""
    screener = QualityScreener()
    result = screener.analyze_stock(ticker)

    if action == "BUY":
        if result.tier == QualityTier.WEAK:
            return f"SKIP: {ticker} has weak quality (score: {result.composite_score:.1f})"
        elif len([rf for rf in result.red_flags if rf.severity == "HIGH"]) >= 2:
            return f"CAUTION: {ticker} has multiple high-severity red flags"

    return f"{action} {shares} shares of {ticker} (Quality: {result.tier.value}, Score: {result.composite_score:.1f})"
```

### Option 3: Daily Quality Report

Add to your daily portfolio analysis:

```python
def generate_daily_report_with_quality():
    """Enhanced daily report with quality metrics."""
    # Existing portfolio analysis
    generate_portfolio_report()

    # Add quality analysis
    screener = QualityScreener()
    holdings = get_portfolio_holdings()

    quality_report = screener.generate_portfolio_quality_report(holdings)

    # Append to daily_portfolio_analysis.md
    with open('daily_portfolio_analysis.md', 'a') as f:
        f.write("\n\n## QUALITY METRICS ANALYSIS\n\n")
        f.write(quality_report)
```
