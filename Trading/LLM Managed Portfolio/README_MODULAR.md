# LLM Managed Portfolio - Modular Structure

The original `Daily_Portfolio_Script.py` has been broken down into smaller, manageable modules while keeping the original file intact.

## 📁 Module Structure

### Core Modules

1. **`trading_models.py`** - Data classes and enums
   - `OrderType`, `OrderPriority`, `PartialFillMode` enums  
   - `TradeOrder` and `TradeResult` dataclasses

2. **`market_hours.py`** - Market hours validation
   - `is_market_open()` - Check if NYSE is open
   - `enforce_market_hours()` - Block execution during closed hours

3. **`performance_validator.py`** - Performance validation system
   - `PerformanceValidator` class with 4 validation methods
   - Cross-validation and consensus reporting

4. **`utils.py`** - Utility functions
   - Chart generation helpers
   - Currency/percentage formatting
   - Date calculations

### Legacy Integration

- **`Daily_Portfolio_Script.py`** - Original file (unchanged)
  - Contains the main `DailyPortfolioReport` class
  - All original functionality preserved

- **`main.py`** - New modular entry point
  - Imports market hours validation
  - Uses original `DailyPortfolioReport` class
  - Maintains full compatibility

## 🚀 Usage

### New Modular Approach (Recommended)
```bash
python main.py
```
- ✅ Market hours validation enabled
- ✅ Clean modular structure
- ✅ Same functionality as original

### Original Method (Still Works)
```bash
python "Daily_Portfolio_Script.py"
```
- ⚠️ No market hours validation
- ⚠️ Single large file

## 📦 Dependencies

Install required packages for market hours validation:
```bash
pip install pandas-market-calendars pytz
```

## 🔧 Market Hours Validation

The new `main.py` automatically validates market hours:

- **Allowed Times**: Monday-Friday, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET
- **Blocked During**: Weekends, holidays, after-hours
- **Smart Detection**: Handles daylight saving time automatically
- **Holiday Aware**: Uses official NYSE calendar

### Example Output When Blocked
```
🚫 MARKET CLOSED
Current time: 2024-01-15 18:30:00 EST
The script can only run during US market hours:
• Monday-Friday, 9:30 AM - 4:00 PM Eastern Time
• On days when NYSE/NASDAQ are open (no holidays)

Please run this script during market hours.
```

## 🔄 Migration Notes

- **No breaking changes** - Original script works exactly the same
- **Additive functionality** - Market hours validation is optional
- **Gradual adoption** - Can switch between old/new entry points
- **Future-ready** - Easy to extract more modules as needed

## 📈 Benefits of Modular Structure

1. **Maintainability** - Smaller, focused files
2. **Testability** - Individual modules can be tested
3. **Reusability** - Modules can be imported elsewhere
4. **Scalability** - Easy to add new features
5. **Safety** - Market hours validation prevents mistimed trades

## 🔮 Future Modules (Planned)

As the system grows, these modules can be extracted:
- `trade_execution.py` - Order execution logic
- `portfolio_analysis.py` - Core portfolio reporting  
- `chart_generation.py` - Visualization components
- `document_parser.py` - Trading document processing

The modular structure makes the codebase more professional and maintainable while preserving all existing functionality.
