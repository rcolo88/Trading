## 🚨 URGENT Issues to Address (Immediate Priority)

### 🚨 1. Portfolio Performance Calculation Bug - CRITICAL
- ❌ Account growth showing -12% when P&L is +28%
- ❌ Chart normalization using wrong baseline
- ❌ Performance metrics using inconsistent denominators

**Root Cause:** Using `self.total_investment` ($1,964) instead of actual investment ($2,000)

**Status: RESOLVED** - Fixed calculations in `generate_report()` and `plot_performance_chart()`

### 🚨 2. Holdings Persistence Bug - CRITICAL  
- ❌ Portfolio holdings reset on every script restart
- ❌ Automated trades execute but changes are lost
- ❌ No permanent state management

**Status: RESOLVED** - Implemented external state file system with `portfolio_state.json`

### 🚨 3. Trade Execution Logging Failure - HIGH
- ❌ `trade_execution.log` file remains empty
- ❌ No audit trail of actual trade executions
- ❌ Logging configuration not properly connected

**Status: RESOLVED** - Fixed logger configuration and added proper trade logging

### 🚨 4. Historical Metrics Data Quality - MEDIUM
- ❌ CSV missing detailed position information
- ❌ No tracking of individual stock performance
- ❌ Limited historical analysis capability

**Status: RESOLVED** - Enhanced CSV export with comprehensive position details

## 🔧 Recent Bug Fixes Implemented

### ✅ 1. Performance Calculation Fix
```python
# BEFORE (Buggy):
total_pnl = total_value - total_cost_basis
account_growth = ((total_value / (self.total_investment + self.cash)) - 1) * 100

# AFTER (Fixed):
initial_investment = 2000.00  # Actual starting amount
total_pnl = total_value - initial_investment
account_growth = ((total_value / initial_investment) - 1) * 100
```

### ✅ 2. State Persistence System
```python
# NEW: External state management
def save_portfolio_state(self):
    # Saves to portfolio_state.json
def load_portfolio_state(self):
    # Loads from portfolio_state.json on startup
```

### ✅ 3. Enhanced Logging
```python
# NEW: Proper trade execution logging
trade_logger.info(f"SOLD {shares} shares of {ticker} at ${price:.2f}")
trade_logger.info(f"BOUGHT {shares} shares of {ticker} at ${price:.2f}")
```

### ✅ 4. Comprehensive Historical Tracking
```python
# NEW: Enhanced CSV export
current_metrics[f"{ticker}_shares"] = pos['shares']
current_metrics[f"{ticker}_entry_price"] = pos['entry_price']
current_metrics[f"{ticker}_current_price"] = pos['current_price']
# ... 8 metrics per position
```
