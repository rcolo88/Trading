# Investment Research: Fundamental Metrics and LLM Strategies for Growth Companies

Academic research overwhelmingly shows that **profitability and quality metrics** predict stock returns better than traditional value metrics alone, while **forward-looking LLM prompts** can identify transformative companies that traditional quantitative screens miss. This dual approach—combining evidence-based fundamental analysis with AI-powered narrative research—offers investors a comprehensive toolkit for both established and emerging opportunities.

## The fundamental metrics paradox: Quality beats value

For decades, value investing dominated academic discourse, but recent research reveals a surprising truth: **profitability matters more than price**. Robert Novy-Marx's landmark 2013 study in the Journal of Financial Economics demonstrated that gross profitability has roughly the same predictive power as book-to-market ratios, generating 31 basis points per month in excess returns. More striking still, the Fama-French five-factor model (2015) found that profitability (RMW factor) is the only factor delivering consistent excess returns across all economic cycles since 1963—outperforming even during the 2008 crisis with 24% annualized returns.

The academic consensus has shifted dramatically. Where traditional value investors focused on P/E ratios and book value, modern research emphasizes **operating efficiency and earnings quality**. The most robust predictors combine multiple dimensions: high gross profit margins, strong return on equity, low accruals (indicating quality earnings), and conservative asset growth. Companies scoring high on these metrics outperform by 5-20% annually depending on the study period, with gross profitability and asset growth showing the most consistent results.

The implications are clear: investors should prioritize profitable, well-managed companies over simply cheap ones. Yet this creates a challenge for identifying early-stage or transformative companies that lack current profitability—precisely where LLM-based research strategies become invaluable.

## What the research actually says about fundamental factors

### Profitability reigns supreme across all conditions

The profitability premium stands as the most reliable factor in modern finance research. Novy-Marx's "gross profitability premium" research showed that firms with high revenues-minus-COGS divided by assets outperformed low-profitability firms by substantial margins, with the effect particularly pronounced among large-cap stocks. This challenges the traditional small-cap focus of factor investing. The mechanism is elegantly simple: gross profitability represents the cleanest measure of economic efficiency, uncontaminated by discretionary expenses like R&D that traditional net income measures treat as costs.

AQR Capital's "Quality Minus Junk" framework extends this insight, defining quality through four pillars: profitability (ROE, ROA, margins), growth stability, financial safety (low leverage, conservative investments), and payout patterns. Their research across 23 international markets confirms quality stocks deliver superior risk-adjusted returns, particularly during market stress. During bear markets, quality/profitability stocks average +10.7% returns while size factors lose -3.0%.

**Key profitability metrics ranked by academic support:**
- **Gross profitability** (revenue - COGS / assets): Strongest predictor, Sharpe ratio 0.85 for combined profitability/value strategies
- **Return on Equity (ROE)**: Powerful when examining persistence; companies maintaining 15%+ ROE for 10 years vastly outperform
- **Operating profitability**: Performs comparably to gross profitability in Fama-French five-factor model  
- **Free cash flow yield**: Top quintile outperforms bottom by ~10% annually per FactSet research
- **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**: Core quality assessment metric emphasized by practitioners

### Value works—but needs quality overlay

The value premium tells a complicated story. Fama and French's original 1992-1993 research showed value stocks (high book-to-market) outperformed growth by 7.6% annually globally from 1975-1995, persisting across 12 of 13 developed countries. However, the factor suffered a historic drawdown from 2007-2020, losing roughly 50% of its value before resurging in 2022-2024 as interest rates rose.

The solution lies in combining value with quality. Joseph Piotroski's F-Score research (2000, Journal of Accounting Research) demonstrates this powerfully: his 9-factor scoring system combining profitability, leverage, and operating efficiency signals separated winners from losers within value stocks. High F-score firms (8-9 points) in the cheapest quintile earned 23% annually versus -6% for low-score value stocks—a 29 percentage point spread. The lesson is clear: **cheap companies with deteriorating fundamentals are value traps, not opportunities**.

**Most predictive valuation metrics:**
- Multiple metrics together (P/E, P/B, P/CF, P/S, EV ratios) prove more robust than any single measure
- Price-to-earnings ratios: Over 75% of P/E variation driven by future return differences, not growth expectations (Lewellen 2004)
- CAPE ratio (Shiller): Strong predictive power for 4-5 year returns
- Free cash flow yield: Less distorted by accounting, increasingly favored by quantitative investors
- Book-to-market: Long history but recent challenges; works better when industry-adjusted

### Momentum persists but crashes violently

Momentum—buying recent winners and selling losers—generates strong returns but with extreme volatility. Jegadeesh and Titman's foundational 1993 study showed momentum strategies (2-12 month formation periods) yield superior returns globally. AQR's "Value and Momentum Everywhere" research confirmed persistence across eight asset classes. The factor performs best during market expansions (+7.0% in positive years) and excels in the five months before recessions with an 80% hit rate.

The catch: momentum suffers devastating crashes during sharp market reversals when losers rebound violently. These "momentum crashes" can erase years of gains in weeks. Russell Investments analysis shows momentum has low or negative correlation with value, making it an effective diversifier, but the high turnover (stocks must be constantly rebalanced) generates significant transaction costs that eat into returns.

### The asset growth red flag

One of the most robust findings in modern finance is deeply counterintuitive: **companies investing aggressively tend to underperform**. Cooper, Gulen, and Schill's 2008 Journal of Finance paper documented that low asset growth stocks outperform high growth stocks by 20% annually over 40 years. High asset growth firms essentially earned Treasury bill-like returns (~4%), while conservative investors captured equity premiums.

This "asset growth anomaly" reflects diminishing marginal returns to investment and potential overinvestment driven by agency problems or managerial overconfidence. The effect persists for up to five years and works across market caps. Fama and French incorporated this insight as their CMA (Conservative Minus Aggressive) investment factor in the 2015 five-factor model. For investors, the implication is stark: beware of companies dramatically expanding their asset base, especially through acquisitions or aggressive capex, unless matched by proportional profitability improvements.

### Earnings quality separates wheat from chaff

Richard Sloan's seminal 1996 accruals anomaly research in The Accounting Review revealed that **companies with high accruals (earnings exceeding cash flows) consistently underperform**. Low-accrual stocks outperform high-accrual stocks by roughly 10% annually. The mechanism: accruals represent accounting estimates and adjustments that prove less persistent than actual cash generation. High accruals often signal aggressive accounting or unsustainable earnings.

This finding spawned an entire research stream on earnings quality. The key insight: not all earnings are created equal. Cash-based earnings prove more reliable than accrual-heavy earnings. Investors should scrutinize companies where net income significantly exceeds operating cash flow, where working capital balloons, or where discretionary accruals spike—all potential red flags for earnings manipulation or deteriorating business fundamentals.

## Multi-factor approach: How top firms actually invest

Leading quantitative investment firms don't rely on single factors. Research Affiliates recommends a six-factor portfolio combining value, low beta, profitability, investment, momentum, and size. Their research shows diversification benefits outweigh increased costs: adding momentum reduced tracking error by 84 basis points and improved information ratios from 0.46 to 0.57, despite higher turnover.

**Factor performance across economic cycles** (Russell Investments/Kenneth French data, 1927-2024):

Five months before recession: Momentum dominates (+6.7%, 80% hit rate) while value and size struggle. During recession: Quality and profitability factors provide defensive characteristics. Twelve months after recession: Size and value factors perform best as economic recovery favors smaller, cheaper stocks. In bull markets: Momentum excels (+7.0%) while investment factors lag. In bear markets: Quality/profitability shines (+10.7%) while size craters (-3.0%).

Dimensional Fund Advisors, founded by University of Chicago academics, has implemented factor-based investing since 1981, systematically adding factors as research validated them: size (1981), value (early 1990s), profitability (2012-13), and investment (2024). Their approach emphasizes patient trading, minimizing market impact, and maintaining broad diversification—critical implementation details that academic papers often overlook but that determine real-world success.

**Rob Arnott's warning** from Research Affiliates resonates: "Hundreds of factors are vying for investors' attention, but only a handful are robust and able to deliver long-term excess returns." Harvey, Liu, and Zhu's 2016 research suggests most published anomalies result from data mining. The robust factors that pass stringent tests—academic validation across multiple studies, definition robustness across measurement approaches, and logical economic rationale—number perhaps 5-6, not 450.

## The practical bottom line on fundamentals

For stock selection, the academic consensus supports combining multiple factors into screening criteria:

**Quality screens:** High gross profitability, strong ROE (15%+), low accruals (earnings close to cash flows), conservative leverage, high ROIC. **Valuation screens:** Low P/E ratios, low price-to-book, high free cash flow yield—using multiple metrics simultaneously. **Growth screens:** Low asset growth (avoiding aggressive expanders), positive but sustainable revenue growth, improving margins. **Avoid:** High accruals, extreme asset growth, high valuations without corresponding quality metrics, leverage-inflated returns.

The effect sizes matter: documented spreads between top and bottom quintiles range from 5-20% annually depending on metric and period, with profitability and asset growth showing the most consistent results. But timing is critical—factors experience extended underperformance periods (value struggled 2007-2020). No factor works in isolation, and implementation costs can eliminate paper profits. Transaction costs for poorly-constructed factor portfolios can reach 100-200 basis points annually—enough to erase the factor premium entirely.

## Prompting LLMs for forward-looking investment research

While academic research validates backward-looking fundamental metrics, identifying transformative companies requires different approaches. Large Language Models excel at analyzing qualitative factors, synthesizing narratives, and identifying emerging themes—capabilities essential for spotting the next disruptive company before traditional metrics capture their potential.

### The core prompting frameworks that work

**Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting** represents the most critical technique for complex financial analysis. University of Chicago researchers found GPT-4 with CoT prompting outperformed financial analysts in predicting earnings changes. The method breaks multi-step reasoning into sequential, logical steps, forcing the model to show its work. Instead of "Analyze this company," use: "Think step by step: First, analyze revenue trends and drivers. Then, assess profitability metrics and margins. Next, evaluate competitive positioning. Finally, synthesize these factors into an overall financial health assessment."

**Role-based prompting** dramatically improves output quality by establishing context and expertise level. Rather than generic queries, specify: "You are a venture capital analyst with 20 years of experience specializing in enterprise SaaS companies" or "You are a biotech investment analyst evaluating clinical-stage therapeutics." AllianceBernstein research confirms role specification significantly improves contextual relevance and professional-grade analysis.

**Domain-Knowledge Chain-of-Thought (DK-CoT)** augments standard CoT with structured financial context. Prepend company fundamentals, macroeconomic conditions, or industry-specific definitions before asking analytical questions. This approach showed superior performance on stock-related sentiment analysis tasks, particularly when the model needs to weigh multiple contextual factors.

### The three-part prompt structure that delivers results

Effective investment research prompts follow a consistent architecture: **role specification** (define the AI's expertise), **context provision** (comprehensive background including market trends, company metrics, competitive dynamics), and **step-by-step instructions** (break requests into manageable, sequential tasks with explicit output expectations).

Poor prompt: "Tell me about Company X." 

Effective prompt: "You are a competitive intelligence analyst for a VC firm. I'm providing profiles of three competitors in the AI infrastructure space [provide data]. For each competitor, create a SWOT analysis focusing on: unique capabilities and market position (strengths), operational vulnerabilities (weaknesses), market gaps they could exploit (opportunities), and competitive pressures plus regulatory risks (threats). Present in structured bullet format with specific evidence."

**Output specifications** matter enormously. Always define format (bullet points, table, narrative), length constraints (200 words, 10 points), and citation requirements. AllianceBernstein emphasizes defining stakeholder expectations—analysis for sophisticated institutional investors differs vastly from retail client summaries, even when examining identical companies.

### Identifying early-stage companies: Shifting from metrics to narrative

For companies like SMR, USAR, or RR that lack traditional fundamentals, prompt structure must emphasize **forward-looking potential over backward-looking performance**. The key insight: ignore or minimize historical revenue and earnings, traditional valuation multiples, and past financial performance. Instead, focus entirely on future catalysts, inflection points, competitive moats in development, narrative strength, and asymmetric risk-reward scenarios.

**Template for early-stage/pre-revenue analysis:**

```
You are a venture capital analyst evaluating [COMPANY NAME] using forward-looking criteria:

INNOVATION ASSESSMENT
- Core technology and defensibility: What problem does it solve? How disruptive is the solution?
- Intellectual property position and barriers to replication

MARKET OPPORTUNITY  
- Total addressable market (TAM) size and growth rate
- Market timing—emerging trend or mature market?
- Competitive landscape and network effects potential

TEAM EVALUATION

Rate transformative potential: Innovation (1-10), Market Opportunity (1-10), Team Quality (1-10), Scalability (1-10)
```

This framework explicitly deprioritizes current financials in favor of qualitative assessments and future potential—precisely what traditional screens miss but what drives early-stage valuations.

### Thematic investing prompts: Finding companies before they're obvious

The most powerful application of LLMs involves thematic screening—identifying companies positioned to benefit from transformative mega-trends before markets fully price in their potential. Rather than screening for specific financial metrics, prompt the AI to find companies aligned with structural shifts.

**Effective thematic prompt structure:**

```
You are a thematic investment analyst. Identify companies positioned for [SPECIFIC THEME: AI infrastructure, nuclear renaissance, defense modernization, climate tech, longevity biotech].

For each company found:
- Theme alignment: How directly does it benefit? (1-10)
- Market timing: How early in the adoption curve? (1-10)  
- Competitive position: Potential category leader? (1-10)
- Execution capability: Can the team capture this opportunity? (1-10)

Prioritize companies that are:
- Pure-play theme exposure (not tangential)
- Early in market adoption (inflection point ahead)
- Under-the-radar (low current analyst coverage)
- Recent catalysts (funding, partnerships, milestones)

Distinguish "picks and shovels" infrastructure plays from end applications.
```

For SMR-type opportunities specifically, adapt the prompt:

```
Identify companies in the Small Modular Reactor/advanced nuclear space. For each:

REGULATORY PATHWAY: NRC licensing status and expected timeline to operation
MARKET CATALYSTS: Government support (IRA benefits, DOE contracts), utility partnerships, AI/data center power demand
COMPETITIVE POSITION: vs. other SMR companies (NuScale, X-energy, TerraPower), first-mover advantages
TECHNOLOGY STATUS: Design phase / Under regulatory review / Construction / Commercial operation

Key de-risking milestones and timeline to commercialization?
```

### Balancing qualitative and quantitative when data is sparse

For companies in growth phases, limited quantitative data requires creative frameworks that weight qualitative factors heavily. The hybrid approach assigns 30% weight to available metrics (funding rounds, revenue growth if any, burn rate, customer acquisition) and 70% to qualitative assessment.

**Qualitative factors for growth companies:**

**Innovation & technology edge:** Describe the core innovation simply. Is it defensible? Feature or platform? Patent position? **Market positioning:** Attacking underserved niche or creating new market? Quality of early customers? Timing within market cycle? **Management quality:** Founder credibility, track record, ability to attract talent, advisory board strength. **Growth narrative:** Compelling story that aligns with macro trends? Viral/network effect potential? Scalability across geographies? **Future catalysts:** List 3-5 specific events in next 12-18 months that could trigger rerating.

This framework acknowledges that for truly transformative companies, the story and team often matter more than current metrics. Uber pre-profitability, Amazon in its early years, Tesla before Model 3—all would fail traditional value screens but possessed compelling narratives, strong teams, and massive addressable markets.

### Multi-perspective prompting reduces bias

To avoid confirmation bias or overly optimistic assessments, employ multiple prompts with different perspectives:

**Prompt A (Optimistic VC lens):** "You are an optimistic venture capitalist seeking the next unicorn. What makes this company exceptional?"

**Prompt B (Skeptical value lens):** "You are a skeptical value investor. Identify red flags, risks, and reasons this could fail."

**Prompt C (Growth/momentum lens):** "You are a growth investor focused on secular trends. How does market timing favor this company?"

Compare outputs to identify consensus strengths, unique risks the skeptic surfaced, and opportunities the growth investor emphasized. Synthesize into a balanced view incorporating bull case, bear case, and base case scenarios with probability weightings.

## Critical limitations and how to work around them

LLMs suffer from significant limitations in financial contexts that investors must understand. **Hallucinations and factual errors** pose the most serious risk—models generate plausible but incorrect financial data, particularly for specific numbers (stock prices, financial metrics) and recent events beyond training cutoffs. Always verify numbers against source documents and use Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) when possible to ground responses in actual data.

**Mathematical reasoning weaknesses** mean LLMs struggle with complex calculations and may make arithmetic errors. Use code interpreter features when available and verify all calculations independently. Surprisingly, CFA Institute research found general-purpose LLMs (GPT-4, Claude) outperform finance-specific LLMs (BloombergGPT, FinGPT) on complex numerical reasoning, though the specialized models excel at sentiment analysis and financial language understanding.

**Timeliness and data cutoff** issues require explicitly providing current data in prompts. Training data cutoffs (GPT-4: April 2023, Claude 3: August 2023 as of late 2023 releases) mean models lack recent market developments unless fed current information. For real-time analysis, integrate with data APIs or use specialized financial platforms like AlphaSense or Bloomberg that incorporate recent data.

**Lack of true understanding** means LLMs pattern-match rather than genuinely comprehend. They cannot truly assess causality versus correlation or capture subtle financial nuances. BlackRock emphasizes: "Involvement of human experts will remain crucial to any application of AI in investment management." Use LLM outputs as starting points requiring human judgment, never final answers.

**Regulatory and compliance concerns** demand careful implementation. Data privacy issues arise with sensitive financial information; use private/enterprise versions of LLMs with proper data governance. Maintain human oversight and documentation—never rely solely on AI for regulated investment decisions. Explainability requirements mean you must be able to defend investment rationale beyond "the AI said so."

### The hybrid human-AI workflow that works

Effective implementation assigns tasks by comparative advantage. AI handles data gathering, initial summarization, pattern identification across large document sets, and routine analysis. Humans handle final judgment calls, strategy development, relationship management, and nuanced interpretation requiring domain expertise.

Russell Investments' model exemplifies this: LLMs process and summarize qualitative data at scale (hundreds of earnings calls, research reports), feed insights into quantitative models, while analysts focus on high-value judgment calls and relationship building. This creates "well-rounded evaluation combining strengths of both approaches" and saves analysts 5-10 hours per week on routine tasks, time reinvested in strategic thinking.

**Validation framework for every AI output:**
- Verify facts against source documents
- Check calculations independently  
- Assess logical consistency
- Compare against domain expertise
- Identify potential biases or blind spots
- Document assumptions and limitations

## Bringing it together: The integrated approach

The most sophisticated investors combine academic insights on fundamentals with AI-powered narrative research. For **established companies with track records**, apply rigorous quantitative screens based on the academic consensus: prioritize profitability (gross profit margin, ROE, ROIC), assess quality (low accruals, conservative asset growth, moderate leverage), evaluate value using multiple metrics (P/E, P/B, FCF yield), and avoid red flags (high accruals, excessive asset growth).

For **early-stage or transformative companies** lacking traditional metrics, deploy LLM-based research emphasizing forward-looking factors: innovation assessment and defensibility, market opportunity sizing and timing, management team quality and track record, specific catalysts in the next 12-18 months, competitive moat development, and thematic alignment with secular trends.

The synthesis creates powerful investment frameworks. A traditional value screen might identify profitable, cheap companies—but miss the narrative about why they're cheap (is it a value trap or temporary mispricing?). An LLM can analyze earnings call transcripts, management commentary, and industry trends to assess whether the discount reflects terminal decline or temporary headwinds with recovery catalysts ahead.

Conversely, pure narrative research on early-stage companies risks backing compelling stories without substance. But when a pre-revenue nuclear startup (like SMR companies) shows strong IP position, experienced nuclear engineering team, advancing NRC approval timeline, and growing utility partnerships—and you can verify these facts against regulatory filings and industry sources—the combination of qualitative assessment and factual validation builds conviction.

**Platform recommendations for different needs:**

For general research and broad applicability: ChatGPT/GPT-4 or Claude 3.5 (strong reasoning, accessible, versatile). For financial services firms with Bloomberg access: BloombergGPT (financial domain expertise, proprietary data). For cost-sensitive or custom applications: Open-source FinGPT (requires technical expertise but customizable). For specialized workflows: AlphaSense (market intelligence), Quartr (earnings calls), AlphaWatch (PE/hedge fund multi-language support).

## Key takeaways for immediate implementation

**On fundamentals:** Prioritize profitability and quality over cheap valuations alone. The academic evidence overwhelmingly supports that profitable companies with strong returns on capital, low accruals, and conservative growth outperform—even when they appear expensive. Use multi-factor approaches combining quality, value, and momentum while avoiding high-accrual, high-asset-growth companies. Effect sizes are substantial (5-20% annual spreads) but factors experience multi-year droughts requiring patience and discipline.

**On LLM prompting:** Effectiveness depends entirely on prompt quality. Use role-based framing, provide comprehensive context, request step-by-step reasoning, and specify output format explicitly. For growth companies, shift emphasis from historical metrics to future catalysts, management quality, market timing, and thematic alignment. Always validate AI outputs against primary sources—LLMs excel at synthesis and pattern recognition but hallucinate specific facts.

**On integration:** The most powerful approach combines both methodologies. Use fundamental screens to identify quality and value in established companies, then employ LLMs to analyze narratives, assess management credibility through earnings call analysis, and identify inflection points. For early-stage opportunities, lead with thematic LLM research to identify potential winners, then validate with available data on team quality, funding, partnerships, and catalysts.

Start with low-stakes applications to build prompt libraries and validate output quality. Iterate constantly—first prompts are rarely optimal. Maintain human oversight at all decision points. Build systems that leverage AI for efficiency (document summarization, initial screening, pattern identification) while preserving human judgment for strategy, final decisions, and relationship-dependent insights.

The future of investment research is human-AI collaboration, where machines handle information processing at scale and humans provide judgment, creativity, and contextual wisdom. Master both the academic fundamentals and the prompting techniques, and you'll possess a significant edge in identifying both established compounders and transformative disruptors.
