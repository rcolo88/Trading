# Quality Investing: Optimal Market Cap Thresholds and Lookback Periods
## Research Findings

### Executive Summary

Based on extensive analysis of academic and industry research, the size premium has persisted in both U.S. and non-U.S. markets, though its effectiveness varies significantly based on quality filters applied. The traditional approach of limiting quality investing to $100B+ market caps and 10-year ROE histories unnecessarily excludes many promising opportunities. A tiered approach that balances risk and opportunity across different market cap segments appears most optimal.

### Key Findings

#### 1. Market Cap Thresholds

**Large Cap Quality Tier ($50B+)**
- Companies with market capitalizations between $10 billion and $200 billion are considered large-cap
- Most stable, proven track records
- Lower volatility but limited upside potential
- Suitable for 60-70% of a quality portfolio

**Mid Cap Quality Tier ($2B-$50B)**
- Mid-cap companies have market values between $2 billion and $10 billion
- Balance between stability and growth potential
- Often overlooked by institutional investors, creating inefficiencies
- Research by AQR found that focusing on higher quality stocks within smaller market cap ranges significantly enhances the premium
- Suitable for 15-20% of portfolio

**Small Cap Quality Tier ($500M-$2B)**
- Small-cap companies have market values between $250 million and $2 billion
- Higher volatility but significant upside potential
- 92% of bankruptcies in the small cap space were identified ex-ante by falling into the lowest quality deciles, emphasizing the importance of quality filters
- 35% of Russell 2000 companies are not profitable, highlighting the need for careful selection
- Suitable for 10-15% of portfolio when combined with strong quality metrics

#### 2. Optimal Lookback Periods

**Traditional Long-Term View (5-10 Years)**
- Companies with 10 consecutive years of ROE above 15% showed remarkable persistence, with about 75% maintaining their status year-to-year
- Best for identifying established "quality compounders"
- Consistent ROE over 3 to 5 years indicates long-term financial health and efficient management
- Misses turnaround opportunities and recent improvers

**Medium-Term Quality Assessment (2-3 Years)**
- Incremental ROCE and ROE consistently exceeding headline metrics signals highly effective capital deployment and can identify turnarounds early
- Balances stability with ability to capture improving companies
- A consistently high return of 15% or more over 3-5 years reflects ability to create long-term value
- Sufficient to identify sustainable quality improvements

**Short-Term Quality Signals (6-8 Quarters)**
- Three consecutive quarters of improving ROE demonstrates sustainable earnings power
- Positive incremental returns during loss periods indicate effective restructuring
- Best for identifying turnaround candidates
- Should be combined with other quality metrics for validation

### Recommended Portfolio Construction

Based on the research findings, here's an optimized tiered approach:

**Core Holdings (65-70%)**
- Large cap ($50B+) with 5+ years ROE >15%
- Focus on established quality compounders
- ROEs of 15-20% are generally considered good

**Growth Quality (15-20%)**
- Mid cap ($2B-$50B) with 2-3 years ROE >15%
- Focus on companies where incremental ROCE exceeds traditional ROCE by 5%+
- Include improving fundamentals and margin expansion

**Opportunistic Quality (10-15%)**
- Small cap ($500M-$2B) with 6-8 quarters positive ROE trend
- Apply strict quality filters: 
  - Positive free cash flow
  - Debt/Equity <1.0
  - Gross profitability >30%
  - Exclude bottom quintile of quality scores to avoid 92% of potential bankruptcies

**High Risk/Thematic (5-10%)**
- Momentum plays and thematic investments
- Can include pre-profit companies in high-growth sectors
- Strict position sizing and stop-losses

### Quality Metrics Beyond ROE

The research emphasizes using multiple quality metrics:

1. **Gross Profitability**: Gross profitability (Revenue - COGS)/Total Assets has been shown to be one of the strongest quality indicators
2. **Free Cash Flow Yield**: Critical for validating earnings quality
3. **ROIC**: ROIC measures the percentage return a company earns on invested capital and gives a sense of how well a company is using its money
4. **Leverage**: Debt-to-Equity shows how much a company relies on borrowed money, with high D/E indicating more financial risk
5. **Earnings Quality**: Low accruals (<5% of assets) indicate high-quality earnings

### Implementation Considerations

1. **Rebalancing Frequency**: Quarterly for small/mid caps, semi-annually for large caps
2. **Sector Neutrality**: Keeping sector weights similar to the broad market allows finding the best earnings across all sectors without making unintended bets
3. **Geographic Diversification**: Include international markets where quality premiums persist
4. **Risk Management**: 
   - Position limits: No single small cap >2% of portfolio
   - Stop-losses on momentum/thematic positions
   - Regular quality score monitoring

### Conclusion

The evidence strongly supports a more nuanced approach to quality investing than simple $100B+ market cap and 10-year lookback restrictions. By implementing a tiered system that adjusts lookback periods and quality thresholds based on market cap, investors can:

1. Capture opportunities in emerging quality companies
2. Benefit from turnaround situations
3. Maintain portfolio stability through core large-cap holdings
4. Achieve better risk-adjusted returns

The key is maintaining discipline in applying quality filters, especially in smaller market cap segments where skilled active management can exploit scarce analyst coverage and low stock correlation more effectively.

This approach allows investors to benefit from the full spectrum of quality opportunities while managing risk appropriately across different market cap segments.
