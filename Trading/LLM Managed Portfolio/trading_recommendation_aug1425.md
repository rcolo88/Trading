## RISK MANAGEMENT UPDATES

### Dynamic Risk Parameters
**SET STOP-LOSS IONS -15%** - Binary FDA catalyst on Aug 21 requires defined risk despite high conviction
**UPDATE PROFIT-TARGET IONS +100%** - FDA approval likely drives to $70-75 from current $41
**MAX-POSITION-SIZE 25%** - Competition format allows concentration in highest conviction plays
**CASH-RESERVE 3%** - Maintain $50 minimum for opportunistic trades
**RISK-BUDGET AGGRESSIVE** - 11-month competition timeline with 5% lead justifies aggressive positioning

### Position-Specific Risk Adjustments
**SET STOP-LOSS NVDA -15%** - Protect gains ahead of Aug 27 earnings volatility
**UPDATE PROFIT-TARGET CRGY +20%** - Take profits on any energy rally to fund better opportunities
**SET STOP-LOSS AMD -20%** - Wider stop for volatile semiconductor position

## ORDERS

### IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (HIGH PRIORITY)

**SELL 30 shares of RIG** - Oil sector headwinds with Brent crude declining to $50-58/barrel by Q1 2026. Generate immediate cash for FDA catalyst play. Current 65 shares overweight in declining sector.

**SELL 8 shares of CRGY** - Reduce energy exposure from 26 to 18 shares. Sector rotation away from energy with better risk-reward in biotech/tech catalysts. Maintain partial position for diversification.

**SELL all 23 shares of SERV** - Complete exit if Serve Robotics (high cash burn, poor fundamentals). If different ticker, verify identity before execution. Reallocate to AI infrastructure theme.

**BUY 7 shares of IONS** - Double position from 7 to 14 shares ahead of August 21 FDA PDUFA. Donidalorsen shows 87% HAE attack reduction with 85-90% approval probability. Orphan drug designation provides pricing power.

### POSITION MANAGEMENT (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**BUY 1 share of NVDA** - Increase from 2 to 3 shares for August 27 earnings catalyst. China H20 license recovery could add 27 percentage points to growth. Blackwell architecture seeing "incredible demand."

**BUY 2 shares of ALAB** - Initiate position in Astera Labs at ~$92. Pure-play AI infrastructure connectivity specialist with 150% YoY revenue growth. PCIe 6.0 rollout provides near-term catalyst.

**HOLD all 1 shares of AMD** - Maintain position despite -1.04% performance. Data center revenue up 57% YoY with MI350 launch providing 4x computing improvement. Cash constraints prevent additions.

**HOLD all 1 shares of GOOGL** - Keep defensive tech position at 21x P/E. Cloud growth 35% with $67B free cash flow provides stability.

**HOLD all 23 shares of QS** - Maintain battery technology exposure. Cobra separator breakthrough and VW partnership extension to 2028 provide long-term optionality.

### STRATEGIC POSITIONING (LOW PRIORITY)

**BUY 1 share of RKLB** - If cash permits after priority trades, initiate small space position at ~$43. Rocket Lab up 720% with Neutron heavy-lift debut mid-2025 catalyst.

## MARKET ANALYSIS & RATIONALE

### Current Market Environment
Low volatility environment (VIX 14.47) with significant sector rotation underway. Technology down 5% YTD after 2024's +36% creates tactical opportunities. Value outperforming growth by wide margins with basic materials leading at +4.55% YTD. Fed policy supportive with 94% probability of September rate cut.

### Catalyst Calendar
- **August 21, 2025**: IONS FDA PDUFA decision (CRITICAL BINARY EVENT)
- **August 21-23**: Jackson Hole Fed Symposium (dovish guidance expected)
- **August 27, 2025**: NVDA Q2 earnings (consensus $28.7B revenue)
- **September 2025**: Fed rate decision (first cut expected)
- **Mid-2025**: RKLB Neutron rocket debut

### Risk Assessment
Current portfolio overweight energy (21% in CRGY/RIG) during sector decline. Underweight high-growth catalysts with only 7 IONS shares. Cash position too low at $156 for tactical opportunities. Binary event risk concentrated in IONS FDA decision requires position sizing discipline.

### Performance Attribution
Portfolio outperformance (+4.24% vs SPY +2.19%) driven by QS (+10.76%), CRGY (+5.05%), and GOOGL (+4.67%). AMD dragging at -1.04%. Energy positions becoming portfolio headwind as sector weakens.

## STRATEGIC ALLOCATION TARGETS

### Target Portfolio Composition
- **Growth/Momentum**: 40% (NVDA, AMD, ALAB)
- **Value/Cyclical**: 15% (GOOGL, reduced energy)
- **Defensive/Quality**: 5% (partial CRGY retention)
- **Speculative/Catalyst**: 35% (IONS, QS, RKLB)
- **Cash Reserve**: 5% ($50-75)

### Sector Allocation Targets
- **Technology**: 35% (NVDA, AMD, GOOGL, ALAB)
- **Healthcare/Biotech**: 25% (IONS)
- **Energy**: 10% (reduced CRGY, RIG)
- **Materials/Battery**: 15% (QS)
- **Space/Defense**: 5% (RKLB)
- **Cash**: 10% (tactical reserve)

## EXECUTION NOTES

### Cash Flow Management
Execute sells first to generate $400-500 in proceeds. Deploy capital systematically with IONS as priority given August 21 catalyst timing. Reserve $50 minimum for volatility opportunities.

### Timing Considerations
IONS purchases must complete by August 19 (2 days before PDUFA). NVDA additions ideally on any weakness below $180. Energy sells can be staggered over 2-3 days for better execution.

### Partial Fill Instructions
If insufficient cash for full IONS position, prioritize whatever shares affordable. ALAB and RKLB are optional if cash constrained. Maintain all current positions if sells don't execute at target prices.
