## MARKET ANALYSIS & RATIONALE

### Current Market Environment
Financial market volatility elevated in 2025 with VIX expected to decline moderately to 17-18 median level. Trade tensions and tariff concerns creating sector rotation opportunities while Fed rate policy remains accommodative. Technology sector facing uncertainty but AI demand remains robust driver.

### Catalyst Calendar
- IONS: Donidalorsen HAE approval expected, Phase 3 CORE/CORE2 sHTG data September 2025, Innovation Day October 7
- NVDA: GTC event late October for product roadmap updates
- RKLB: Neutron test flight Q4 2025
- Quantum sector: 2026-2027 commercial viability timeline approaching

### Risk Assessment
Portfolio concentration acceptable with largest position (NVDA) at 15.6%. Cash level excessive at 33.4% - deployment opportunity. Semiconductor sector showing extreme dispersion with AI winners vs traditional chips.

### Performance Attribution
Strong outperformance driven by IONS biotech gains (+63.6%), GOOGL AI positioning (+27.4%), MRVL semiconductor recovery (+22.6%). Cash drag on returns needs addressing.
