# Trading recommendations for aggressive growth strategy

## Portfolio rebalancing for 11+ month competition dominance

With the corrected 11+ month timeframe, your current 5.09% lead and 24.4% cash position demand aggressive repositioning. Research reveals **high-conviction catalyst plays and secular growth themes** that can drive the 20-30% annual returns needed for competition victory. The extended timeline shifts strategy from defensive to maximum growth with strategic risk management.

## ORDERS

### IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (HIGH PRIORITY)

**BUY 4 shares of IONS** - Increase from 3 to 7 shares (target 20% allocation). FDA PDUFA August 21, 2025 carries 85-90% approval probability with exceptional clinical data showing 96% reduction in HAE attacks. Binary catalyst offers 40-45% upside potential with limited downside given strong fundamentals.

**BUY 4 shares of NVDA** - Increase from 1 to 5 shares (target 15-18% allocation). August 27 earnings catalyst plus China H20 business restoration could unlock $8B revenue opportunity. Blackwell architecture momentum and dominant 92% data center GPU market share positions for significant reacceleration.

**BUY 3 shares of AMD** - Increase from 1 to 4 shares (target 12-15% allocation). Data center revenue up 57% YoY with MI350 series launch providing 4x computing power improvement. Undervalued at 40x forward P/E given trajectory toward 30% market share in $500B data center GPU market.

**BUY 150 shares of ALAB** - New position targeting 15% allocation (~$28,800 at $192). Pure-play AI infrastructure leader with 150% YoY revenue growth. PCIe 6.0 rollout and NVIDIA Blackwell integration provide near-term catalysts with 30-56% upside potential.

**BUY 700 shares of RKLB** - New position targeting 12% allocation (~$30,100 at $43). Space commercialization leader with proven Electron rocket (90%+ success rate) and Neutron heavy-lift debut mid-2025. NASA Mars contract and national security expansion drive 50-85% upside potential.

### POSITION MANAGEMENT (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**BUY 8 shares of GOOGL** - Increase from 1 to 9 shares (target 10% allocation). Quality tech defensive play trading at lowest Magnificent Seven P/E (21x) with strong fundamentals including 35% Google Cloud growth and $67B free cash flow.

**BUY 60 shares of SWTX** - New biotech catalyst position targeting 8% allocation (~$16,800 at $35). FDA priority review with PDUFA February 28, 2025 for mirdametinib treating neurofibromatosis type 1. Strong cash position and rare disease advantages suggest 70-115% upside potential.

**BUY 400 shares of FLNC** - New energy storage recovery play targeting 8% allocation (~$4,800 at $12). Down 42% YTD despite 31% expected revenue growth, creating opportunity. IRA tax credits and utility-scale wins support 85-135% upside as scale improves margins.

**HOLD QS current position** - Maintain 23 shares representing solid 10% allocation. Cobra separator breakthrough and VW partnership extension to 2028 provide runway. QSE-5 prototype production 2025 with commercialization timeline 2027-2028 offers transformative potential if executed.

**TRIM CRGY by 8 shares** - Reduce from 26 to 18 shares (lower allocation to 6%). While fundamentals strong with record production and $171M free cash flow, energy sector headwinds conflict with AI/tech competition theme. Redeploy proceeds to highest-conviction AI infrastructure plays.

**TRIM SERV by 10 shares** - Reduce from 23 to 13 shares (lower allocation to 3%). Extreme valuation at 156x P/S and $50M+ annual cash burn creates excessive risk. Maintain small optionality position in $860B autonomous delivery market but focus capital on higher-probability opportunities.

**SELL all 65 shares of RIG** - Exit only losing position (-1.17%) to eliminate oil drilling exposure conflicting with growth theme focus. Despite potential contrarian value, opportunity cost too high versus AI infrastructure and biotech catalyst opportunities over 11+ month timeframe.

**MAINTAIN cash at 5-8%** - After aggressive deployment of current 24.4% cash position, maintain 5-8% reserve for tactical opportunities during market volatility or catalyst-driven corrections in high-conviction names.

## Strategic rationale and catalyst timeline

This rebalancing transforms the portfolio from defensive diversification to **concentrated conviction** around three secular themes generating massive alpha potential. **AI infrastructure explosion** drives core positions in NVDA, AMD, and ALAB as data center electricity usage doubles by 2026. **Biotech catalyst pipeline** leverages IONS August PDUFA and SWTX February PDUFA for asymmetric risk-reward opportunities.

**Space commercialization acceleration** through RKLB captures the $630B to $1.8T market expansion by 2035. The aggressive 15-20% individual position sizing appropriate for 11+ month competition format, departing from traditional portfolio theory to maximize competitive advantage.

Key catalyst sequence includes IONS FDA decision August 21 (90% probability success), NVDA earnings August 27 (China recovery catalyst), and extensive Q4 2025 biotech PDUFA calendar creating continuous alpha opportunities. **Risk management** maintains 15% maximum individual positions with systematic stop-losses at 15-20% levels appropriate for growth strategy volatility tolerance.

Current low VIX environment (14.41) and strong market momentum (SPY 646) support aggressive positioning, while maintaining flexibility for quarterly rebalancing as themes evolve through July 2026 competition conclusion.
