## ORDERS

### IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (HIGH PRIORITY)

**SELL 13 shares of IONS** - Reduce concentration from 21 to 8 shares (43.4% to ~16% allocation). Binary FDA decision Aug 21 creates unacceptable portfolio risk. Maintain exposure but protect capital.

**SELL all 35 shares of RIG** - Complete exit at $2.96. Oil declining to $50-58/barrel by Q1 2026. Offshore drilling faces structural headwinds. Generate $103 cash for redeployment.

**SELL all 10 shares of CRGY** - Exit entire position at $9.47. Energy sector underperformance expected despite strong Q2 results. Raise $95 cash for better opportunities.

### POSITION MANAGEMENT (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**HOLD all 2 shares of NVDA** - Maintain position ahead of Aug 27 earnings. Goldman Sachs $200 target with revenue estimates $45.7B. China recovery potential adds upside.

**HOLD all 23 shares of QS** - Keep battery technology exposure. PowerCo funding secured with VW partnership extended to 2028. Solid-state battery commercialization progressing.

**HOLD all 1 shares of GOOGL** - Defensive tech allocation at reasonable valuation. AI Overviews reaching 1.5B users monthly. Cloud growth remains strong.

**HOLD all 1 shares of AMD** - Limited downside at current 8.5% allocation. Data center growth intact despite competition. MI350 launch provides catalyst.

### STRATEGIC POSITIONING (LOW PRIORITY)

**BUY 2 shares of ALAB** - If cash permits after sales, initiate Astera Labs position at ~$92. AI infrastructure connectivity pure-play with 150% revenue growth.

**SET STOP-LOSS QS -20%** - Position-specific risk management at $7.10
**UPDATE PROFIT-TARGET NVDA +20%** - Revised target $218 post-earnings

## MARKET ANALYSIS & RATIONALE

### Current Market Environment
VIX at 14.78 signals dangerous complacency with August seasonality historically negative. S&P 500 near records while breadth deteriorates. Sector rotation continues from growth to value with energy underperforming. Fed rate cut probability 87-99% for September but forward guidance uncertain.

### Catalyst Calendar
- **August 21, 2025**: IONS FDA PDUFA decision (CRITICAL BINARY EVENT)
- **August 21-23**: Jackson Hole Fed Symposium (policy guidance)
- **August 27, 2025**: NVDA Q2 earnings (consensus $45.7B revenue)
- **September 2025**: Fed rate decision (first cut expected)
- **Q4 2025**: QS production milestone updates

### Risk Assessment
Current 43.4% IONS concentration represents existential portfolio risk ahead of binary catalyst. Cash position at 1.4% eliminates tactical flexibility. Energy exposure during sector decline drags performance. Insufficient diversification threatens competition viability.

### Performance Attribution
Portfolio +4.14% driven by GOOGL (+6.72%), QS (+4.44%), and CRGY (+4.07%). IONS position +2.29% but creates dangerous concentration. RIG underwater at -1.18%. Overall outperforming SPY but risk-adjusted returns poor.

## STRATEGIC ALLOCATION TARGETS

### Target Portfolio Composition
- **Growth/Momentum**: 25% (NVDA, AMD)
- **Value/Cyclical**: 10% (GOOGL)
- **Defensive/Quality**: 15% (cash reserves)
- **Speculative/Catalyst**: 35% (IONS, QS, ALAB)
- **Cash Reserve**: 15% ($300-400)

### Sector Allocation Targets
- **Technology**: 35% (NVDA, AMD, GOOGL, ALAB)
- **Healthcare/Biotech**: 16% (IONS reduced)
- **Energy**: 0% (complete exit)
- **Materials/Battery**: 10% (QS)
- **Space/Defense**: 0% (skip RKLB)
- **Cash**: 15% (tactical reserve)

## EXECUTION NOTES

### Cash Flow Management
Execute IONS reduction and energy exits immediately to generate $700+ proceeds. This creates 15% cash position for risk management and opportunities. Maintain strict position sizing going forward with no single holding above 20%.

### Timing Considerations
IONS reduction must complete by August 19 (2 days before PDUFA). Energy exits can execute immediately at market. ALAB initiation only if sufficient cash after priority trades.

### Partial Fill Instructions
IONS reduction is mandatory - sell 13 shares regardless of price. Energy exits are full positions with no partial fills. New positions optional based on available cash after sales.
