## üìã ORDERS SECTION

### üî• IMMEDIATE EXECUTION (HIGH PRIORITY)

**REDUCE IONS by 3 shares** - Trim position from 21.7% to 15% portfolio weight to manage concentration risk while maintaining upside exposure to September 22 PDUFA catalyst

**BUY 3 shares of CRNX** - September 25 PDUFA for Paltusotine acromegaly treatment offers 118% upside to $74 analyst targets with high approval probability

**BUY 5 shares of MRVL** - AI networking leader targeting $34B market by 2028, trading at discount to peers with 400G/800G Ethernet adoption accelerating

### ‚öñÔ∏è POSITION MANAGEMENT (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**BUY 2 shares of TSM** - Essential foundry exposure for AI semiconductor plays, geopolitical discount creates opportunity with 3nm/2nm node leadership

**HOLD all 8 shares of IONS** - Maintain core position through September 22 PDUFA catalyst and Q3 earnings momentum

**HOLD all 2 shares of NVDA** - Blackwell ramp in Q1 2025 maintains competitive moat despite near-term China headwinds

**BUY 2 shares of RKLB** - Space technology momentum with 80% YTD performance, 70 successful missions, and policy tailwinds

### üìà STRATEGIC POSITIONING (LOW PRIORITY)

**BUY 1 share of PANW** - Cybersecurity leader for portfolio diversification with platformization strategy driving 40% operating margins

**SET STOP-LOSS AMD -18%** - Protect against further China-related weakness while allowing room for MI350 catalyst

**UPDATE PROFIT-TARGET QS +50%** - Raise target based on September Ducati demo success and 2026 automotive testing timeline

## MARKET ANALYSIS & RATIONALE

### Current Market Environment
Markets navigate complex crosscurrents with S&P 500 at 93rd percentile valuations while Fed cuts rates despite 2.9% inflation. Narrow market leadership concentrated in mega-cap tech creates stock-picking opportunities. VIX at multi-year lows (15.63) suggests complacency amid geopolitical risks from Taiwan semiconductor dependence and Middle East tensions. Sector rotation favors defensive healthcare and international diversification.

### Catalyst Calendar
- September 22: IONS olezarsen PDUFA decision (blockbuster potential)
- September 25: CRNX Paltusotine acromegaly PDUFA
- October 29: AMD Q3 earnings with MI350 AI chip updates
- November 9: RGNX gene therapy approval for Hunter syndrome
- November 20: NVDA Q3 earnings with Blackwell production ramp
- Q1 2025: Multiple biotech FDA decisions creating volatility opportunities

### Risk Assessment
Portfolio concentration risk elevated with IONS at 21.7% weight requiring reduction. Taiwan semiconductor exposure across NVDA/AMD creates geopolitical vulnerability. High cash position (33%) provides downside protection but creates performance drag. Low portfolio correlation with defensive ETF positions (XLV, VEA, TLT) balancing growth exposure.

### Performance Attribution
IONS (+44.36%) and GOOGL (+30.56%) drive outperformance through successful catalyst execution. AMD (-9.38%) weakness from China restrictions offset by data center strength. High cash allocation dampened returns but preserved capital for deployment opportunities. International (VEA) and healthcare (XLV) diversification provided stability.

## STRATEGIC ALLOCATION TARGETS

### Target Portfolio Composition
- **Growth/Momentum**: 45%
- **Value/Cyclical**: 15%
- **Defensive/Quality**: 20%
- **Speculative/Catalyst**: 10%
- **Cash Reserve**: 10%

### Sector Allocation Targets
- **Technology**: 35%
- **Healthcare/Biotech**: 30%
- **Energy**: 0%
- **Financial**: 5%
- **Consumer**: 10%
- **Other**: 20%

## EXECUTION NOTES

### Cash Flow Management
Execute IONS reduction first to generate approximately $182 for new positions. Deploy $400 of $675 cash balance across high-conviction catalyst plays while maintaining 10% reserve. Prioritize near-term catalysts (CRNX, MRVL) over longer-term positions to maximize 3-8 month return window.

### Timing Considerations
Complete IONS reduction before September 22 PDUFA to lock partial gains. Enter CRNX position immediately given September 25 catalyst proximity. MRVL and TSM entries can scale over 2-3 days for better average pricing given lower urgency.

### Partial Fill Instructions
For CRNX position, accept partial fills above 2 shares given catalyst timing. MRVL and TSM positions can wait for full fills at target prices. Maintain strict 10% cash reserve minimum after all executions.
