## ü§ñ LLM COMPLETION INSTRUCTIONS

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL PARSING REQUIREMENTS

**The trading system will automatically parse your output. Follow these rules EXACTLY or orders will fail:**

1. **Action Words**: Only use: `BUY`, `SELL`, `REDUCE`, `HOLD`, `SET STOP-LOSS`, `UPDATE PROFIT-TARGET`
2. **Ticker Format**: Always UPPERCASE (NVDA, AMD, TSLA) - never lowercase
3. **Share Quantities**: Always use exact numbers (15, 100, 250) - never "some" or "few"
4. **Order Format**: Always start with `**` and include ` - ` before reasoning
5. **Priority Sections**: Keep orders in their priority sections for proper execution flow

### üìù EXACT SYNTAX REQUIREMENTS

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT Order Formats:
```
**BUY 15 shares of NVDA** - AI infrastructure momentum driving growth
**SELL 10 shares of AMD** - Profit taking at resistance level
**SELL all 19 shares of SOUN** - Exit underperforming position
**HOLD all 23 shares of QS** - Maintain allocation ahead of earnings
**REDUCE TSLA by 50 shares** - Trim position after strong run
```

#### ‚úÖ CORRECT Risk Management Formats:
```
**SET STOP-LOSS NVDA -15%** - Protect against AI sector volatility
**UPDATE PROFIT-TARGET IONS +40%** - Increase target based on pipeline progress
**MAX-POSITION-SIZE 20%** - Limit individual position risk
**CASH-RESERVE 5%** - Maintain liquidity for opportunities
**RISK-BUDGET MODERATE** - Balanced approach given market conditions
```

#### ‚ùå INCORRECT Formats (WILL FAIL):
```
Buy some nvda shares - AI looks good (lowercase, vague quantity)
**BUY NVDA 15 shares**: Good opportunity (wrong word order, colon instead of dash)
**Purchase 15 NVDA** ‚Üí Momentum play (wrong action word, wrong separator)
**BUY 15 NVDA** Due to earnings (missing "shares of", wrong separator)
```

### üéØ COMPLETION GUIDELINES

2. **Use current market data** - Reference actual market conditions
3. **Be specific with reasoning** - Include catalysts, technicals, fundamentals
