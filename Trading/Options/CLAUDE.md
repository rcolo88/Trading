# SPY/SPX Options Backtesting System

## Project Overview
A Python-based backtesting system for options trading strategies, focusing on vertical spreads (bull/bear put/call spreads) and calendar spreads (time spreads) on SPY/SPX. Built using the Optopsy library for robust options strategy analysis.

## Goals
- Backtest vertical spread and calendar spread strategies on 3-5 years of SPY/SPX historical data
- Analyze performance metrics: P&L, win rate, max drawdown, Sharpe ratio
- Identify optimal entry/exit parameters for credit spreads, debit spreads, and time spreads
- Build a flexible framework that can be extended to other strategies and underlyings

### Synthetic Options Data Generation 🔬

**When Free Data is Unavailable or Insufficient**

Since obtaining 2+ years of accurate historical options data for free is challenging, generating synthetic options data using the Black-Scholes model is a **viable alternative** for backtesting strategy performance.

#### GitHub Reference Implementation
- **Repository**: `aspiringfastlaner/spx_options_backtesting`
- **Description**: Python scripts for backtesting SPX put strategies using Black-Scholes proxies
- **Approach**: Uses historical underlying prices with Black-Scholes model to estimate option prices
- **Use case**: Demonstrates practical implementation of synthetic options data for backtesting

#### Methodology: Generating Synthetic Options Chains

**Step 1: Obtain Underlying Price Data**
```python
# Free from Yahoo Finance via yfinance
import yfinance as yf
spy = yf.Ticker("SPY")
prices = spy.history(start="2022-01-01", end="2024-12-31")
```

**Step 2: Calculate Historical Volatility**
```python
# Rolling historical volatility calculation
returns = prices['Close'].pct_change()
volatility = returns.rolling(window=30).std() * np.sqrt(252)
```

**Step 3: Generate Options Chain Using Black-Scholes**
```python
# Using py_vollib library
from py_vollib.black_scholes import black_scholes
from py_vollib.black_scholes.greeks.analytical import delta, gamma, theta, vega

# For each trading day:
for date in trading_dates:
    S = underlying_price[date]  # Spot price
    K = strike_prices  # Array of strikes around current price
    T = days_to_expiration / 365  # Time to expiration in years
    r = risk_free_rate  # Treasury rate (e.g., 0.04 for 4%)
    sigma = historical_volatility[date]  # Calculated volatility

    # Calculate option prices
    call_price = black_scholes('c', S, K, T, r, sigma)
    put_price = black_scholes('p', S, K, T, r, sigma)

    # Calculate Greeks
    call_delta = delta('c', S, K, T, r, sigma)
    put_delta = delta('p', S, K, T, r, sigma)
    # ... gamma, theta, vega
```

**Step 4: Generate Delta-Targeted Strikes**
```python
# For vertical spreads, we need specific deltas (e.g., 0.30, 0.20)
def find_strike_by_delta(target_delta, option_type, S, T, r, sigma):
    """Binary search to find strike matching target delta"""
    # Implementation finds strike where delta ≈ target_delta
```

**Step 5: Create Standard Expirations**
```python
# Generate weekly and monthly expirations
expirations = []
# Weekly: Every Friday
# Monthly: 3rd Friday of each month
# Calculate DTE for each date
```

#### Accuracy Considerations

**✅ Strengths:**
- **Good for relative comparisons**: Comparing strategy A vs B performance trends
- **Free and reproducible**: No data costs, fully controlled
- **Sufficient for most backtests**: Especially 30-45 DTE strategies in normal markets
- **Educational value**: Understand options pricing fundamentals

**⚠️ Limitations:**
1. **Constant volatility assumption**: Real volatility varies by strike (volatility smile/skew)
   - Impact: May misprince OTM options
   - Solution: Use implied volatility surface if available, or accept approximation

2. **Model assumptions**: Black-Scholes assumes:
   - No dividends (SPY does pay dividends - use Black-Scholes-Merton instead)
   - Constant risk-free rate
   - Log-normal returns
   - No transaction costs
   - European-style exercise (American options can be exercised early)

3. **Crisis periods**:
   - Research shows 100%+ mispricing during 2008 crisis and COVID-19
   - Underestimates tail risk
   - Normal market R² ≈ 88% vs real data, crisis R² << 50%

4. **Longer-dated options**:
   - Accuracy decreases significantly for 60+ DTE
   - Our use case (30-45 DTE) is within acceptable range

5. **Bid-Ask spread**:
   - Synthetic data produces mid-market prices
   - Need to manually add realistic spread (e.g., 2-5% of option price)

6. **Liquidity**:
   - Real options may not always be tradeable at model prices
   - Especially true for far OTM/ITM strikes

#### When Synthetic Data is Acceptable

**✅ Good for:**
- Comparing vertical spread strategies (bull put vs bear call)
- Testing entry/exit timing rules
- Optimizing delta targets and DTE parameters
- Understanding strategy behavior in trending/ranging markets
- Educational/learning purposes
- Proof of concept before investing in real data

**❌ Not recommended for:**
- High-frequency trading strategies
- Crisis period analysis (use real data)
- Precise P&L forecasting (use for relative trends only)
- Strategies sensitive to volatility skew (e.g., ratio spreads)
- Production trading decisions

#### Implementation in This Project

**Recommended Approach:**
1. Start with synthetic data generation for immediate backtesting
2. Validate framework logic and strategy implementation
3. Test parameter sensitivity and optimization
4. Document assumptions clearly in backtest reports
5. Upgrade to real data (OptionsDX free tier or Polygon.io) when:
   - Moving toward live trading
   - Need higher accuracy for specific trades
   - Conducting professional-grade research

**Files to Implement:**
- `src/data_fetchers/synthetic_generator.py` - Main generator
- `src/utils/black_scholes.py` - Pricing and Greeks calculations
- `config/config.yaml` - Add volatility model settings
- Documentation warnings in backtest outputs

#### Research-Backed Accuracy Benchmarks

Based on academic studies comparing Black-Scholes to real market data:
- **Normal markets**: 88% R² correlation with actual prices
- **Near-term options (< 45 DTE)**: Price differences typically < 10%
- **At-the-money options**: Highest accuracy (< 5% error)
- **30 delta options**: Within acceptable range for backtesting trends
- **Crisis periods**: Accuracy drops significantly, use with caution

**Conclusion**: Synthetic data generation is a **practical and cost-effective solution** for backtesting vertical spread strategies on SPY, especially when combined with awareness of its limitations and proper risk disclaimers.

- **Setup**: Sell near-term call, buy far-term call (same strike)
- **Max profit**: When underlying is at strike at near-term expiration
- **Max loss**: Net debit paid
- **Use case**: Neutral to slightly bullish, expect low volatility
- **Best conditions**: Low IV environment, expecting IV to increase

#### 2. Put Calendar Spread (Time Spread)
- **Setup**: Sell near-term put, buy far-term put (same strike)
- **Max profit**: When underlying is at strike at near-term expiration
- **Max loss**: Net debit paid
- **Use case**: Neutral to slightly bearish, expect low volatility
- **Best conditions**: Low IV environment, expecting IV to increase

#### 3. Diagonal Spread (Time + Vertical Combination)
- **Setup**: Sell near-term option, buy far-term option (different strikes)
- **Call diagonal**: Sell lower strike near-term call, buy higher strike far-term call
- **Put diagonal**: Sell higher strike near-term put, buy lower strike far-term put
- **Max profit**: Varies based on strikes and expiration
- **Max loss**: Net debit paid
- **Use case**: Combines time decay with directional bias
- **Status**: Framework implemented, available for future enhancement

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Data Limitations
1. **Historical Options Data**: Free sources are limited
   - 3-5 years of comprehensive SPY options data is difficult to obtain for free
   - May need to start with 1-2 years and document upgrade path to paid sources
   - Optopsy works with various data formats, so migration should be straightforward

2. **Data Granularity**: Free sources may provide daily or hourly data vs tick-level
   - Hour-level data from QuantConnect may miss intraday volatility
   - Acceptable for most strategies but limits high-frequency testing

3. **Survivorship Bias**: Free datasets may not include all expired contracts
   - Could skew results if incomplete

### Technical Debt
- Need to establish data quality checks
- Transaction cost assumptions need validation
- Slippage models are estimates

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term
- Implement diagonal spread strike selection logic (different strikes)
- Add iron condor and iron butterfly strategies
- Implement rolling strategies (close and reopen positions)
- Add volatility-based entry signals (VIX, IV rank)
- Create paper trading integration with Schwab API
- Optimize calendar spread exit logic for theta decay

### Long-term
- Machine learning for parameter optimization
- Real-time monitoring dashboard
- Multi-asset backtesting (QQQ, IWM, stocks)
- Portfolio-level risk management
- Integration with live trading (Schwab API)
- Options pricing model validation (compare historical vs theoretical)

## Research Notes

### Optopsy Library
- **GitHub**: github.com/michaelchu/optopsy
- **Stars**: ~1.2k
- **Status**: Maintained, last update 2024
- **Key Features**:
  - Built-in support for vertical spreads, iron condors, straddles, strangles
