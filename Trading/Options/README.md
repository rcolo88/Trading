## Data Options

### Free Historical Data (Recommended for Getting Started)

**Synthetic Data Generation (Black-Scholes)**
Generate 2+ years of realistic options data for free using actual SPY prices:

```bash
python generate_synthetic_data.py
```

This will:
- Fetch SPY prices from Yahoo Finance (free)
- Calculate historical volatility
- Generate options chains using Black-Scholes pricing
- Include Greeks (delta, gamma, theta, vega)
- Save to `data/processed/SPY_synthetic_options_*.csv`

**Pros:** Free, realistic for most backtests, includes all necessary data
**Cons:** Less accurate during crises, assumes constant volatility per strike

**OptionsDX (Real Historical Data - Free Tier)**
- Visit https://www.optionsdx.com
- Create free account
- Download SPY historical options data (EOD back to 2010)
- Free tier available with account signup

**Polygon.io (Real Historical Data - Free Trial)**
- Sign up at https://polygon.io
- Free tier: 2 years of options data, 5 API calls/min
- May require paid upgrade for practical backtesting

See `CLAUDE.md` for detailed comparison and instructions.

## Exit Criteria Explained

### How Profit Targets and Stop Losses Work

All strategies use **percentage-based exit criteria** for consistency and clarity.

#### Vertical Spreads (Credit and Debit)

**Profit Target** = Percentage of maximum profit to capture before exiting
**Stop Loss** = Percentage of maximum loss to tolerate before exiting

**Example 1: Bull Put Spread (Credit Spread)**
```
Entry: Sell $420 put / Buy $415 put for $2.00 credit
Strike width: $5
Max profit: $2.00 (credit received)
Max loss: $3.00 ($5 width - $2 credit)

Config:
  profit_target: 0.50  # Exit at 50% of max profit
  stop_loss: 0.50      # Exit at 50% of max loss

Exit conditions:
✓ Profit target: Exit when spread is worth $1.00 (captured $1.00 profit = 50% of $2.00 max profit)
✓ Stop loss: Exit when you've lost $1.50 (50% of $3.00 max loss)
```

**Example 2: Bull Call Spread (Debit Spread)**
```
Entry: Buy $410 call / Sell $415 call for $2.00 debit
Strike width: $5
Max profit: $3.00 ($5 width - $2 debit)
Max loss: $2.00 (debit paid)

Config:
  profit_target: 0.75  # Exit at 75% of max profit
  stop_loss: 0.50      # Exit at 50% of max loss

Exit conditions:
✓ Profit target: Exit when spread is worth $4.25 (gained $2.25 = 75% of $3.00 max profit)
✓ Stop loss: Exit when spread is worth $1.00 (lost $1.00 = 50% of $2.00 max loss)
```

#### Calendar Spreads

**Profit Target** = Percentage gain on the debit paid
**Stop Loss** = Percentage loss on the debit paid (negative value)

**Example: Call Calendar Spread**
```
Entry: Sell 30 DTE call / Buy 60 DTE call at $420 strike for $3.00 debit
Max loss: $3.00 (debit paid)

Config:
  profit_target: 0.25    # Exit at 25% profit
  stop_loss: -0.50       # Exit at 50% loss
  dte_exit: 7            # Exit when near-term ≤ 7 DTE
  max_underlying_move: 0.10  # Exit if underlying moves >10% from strike

Exit conditions:
✓ Profit target: Exit when spread is worth $3.75 (25% profit = $0.75 gain)
✓ Stop loss: Exit when spread is worth $1.50 (50% loss = $1.50 loss)
✓ DTE exit: Exit 7 days before near-term expiration (mandatory)
✓ Movement: Exit if SPY moves from $420 to >$462 or <$378 (>10% move)
```

### Recommended Settings

**Credit Spreads** (Bull Put, Bear Call):
- `profit_target: 0.50` - Take profits at 50% of max profit (common wisdom)
- `stop_loss: 0.50` - Cut losses at 50% of max loss
- `dte_min: 21` - Exit when DTE drops below 21 days

**Debit Spreads** (Bull Call, Bear Put):
- `profit_target: 0.75` - Take profits at 75% of max profit
- `stop_loss: 0.50` - Cut losses at 50% of max loss
- `dte_min: 14` - Exit when DTE drops below 14 days

**Calendar Spreads**:
- `profit_target: 0.25` - Take 25% profit on debit paid
- `stop_loss: -0.50` - Cut losses at 50% of debit paid
- `dte_exit: 7` - Exit 7 days before near-term expiration
- `max_underlying_move: 0.10` - Exit if underlying moves >10%

## Configuration

Key configuration parameters in `config/config.yaml`:

**Vertical Spread Example:**
```yaml
strategies:
  bull_put_spread:
    entry:
      dte_min: 30          # Enter with 30-45 DTE
      dte_max: 45
      short_delta: 0.30    # Sell 30 delta put
      long_delta: 0.20     # Buy 20 delta put
      strike_width: 5      # $5 wide spread
    exit:
      profit_target: 0.50  # Close at 50% of max profit
      stop_loss: 0.50      # Stop at 50% of max loss
      dte_min: 21          # Close if < 21 DTE
```

**Calendar Spread Example:**
```yaml
strategies:
  call_calendar:
    entry:
      near_dte: 30              # Sell 30 DTE call
      far_dte: 60               # Buy 60 DTE call
      strike_selection: "atm"   # ATM, delta, or moneyness
      min_debit: 0.5            # Minimum debit to enter
    exit:
      profit_target: 0.25       # Close at 25% profit
      stop_loss: -0.50          # Stop at 50% loss
      dte_exit: 7               # Exit when near-term ≤ 7 DTE
      max_underlying_move: 0.10 # Exit if underlying moves >10% from strike
```

## How to Modify Exit Criteria

### Step 1: Edit config/config.yaml

Open `config/config.yaml` and locate the strategy you want to modify:

```yaml
strategies:
  bull_put_spread:
    exit:
      profit_target: 0.50  # Change this to your desired profit %
      stop_loss: 0.50      # Change this to your desired loss %
      dte_min: 21          # Change this to your desired DTE threshold
```

### Step 2: Understanding the Values

**Profit Target** (0.0 to 1.0):
- `0.50` = Exit at 50% of max profit
- `0.75` = Exit at 75% of max profit
- `0.25` = Exit at 25% of max profit

**Stop Loss** (0.0 to 1.0):
- `0.50` = Exit at 50% of max loss
- `0.75` = Exit at 75% of max loss (more risk tolerant)
- `0.25` = Exit at 25% of max loss (less risk tolerant)

**DTE Minimum** (integer):
- `21` = Exit when position has 21 or fewer days to expiration
- `14` = Exit when position has 14 or fewer days to expiration
- `7` = Exit when position has 7 or fewer days to expiration

### Step 3: Run Backtest and Compare

```python
# Run backtest with your new parameters
python example_backtest.py

# Or use the Jupyter notebook to compare multiple configurations
jupyter notebook notebooks/backtest_analysis.ipynb
```

### Step 4: Analyze Results

The backtester will show:
- How many trades hit profit target vs stop loss
- Average days in trade
- Win rate and profit factor
- Overall P&L and Sharpe ratio

Use these metrics to optimize your exit criteria.

## Next Steps

1. **Install and test** with sample data
2. **Generate synthetic data** using `python generate_synthetic_data.py`
3. **Run your first backtest** with default parameters
4. **Modify exit criteria** in config.yaml based on results
5. **Optimize parameters** by testing different configurations
6. **Backtest multiple strategies** and compare results
7. **Paper trade** using Schwab API integration (future enhancement)
