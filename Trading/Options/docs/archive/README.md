   - Comprehensive validation of delta values across 168 test cases
   - Comparison to theoretical expectations
   - Time decay patterns and industry standard alignment
   - **Consolidated into**: CLAUDE.md "Delta Calculations - Validation & Accuracy" section

2. **DELTA_INVESTIGATION_SUMMARY.md** (Oct 26, 2025)
   - Summary of delta validation against py_vollib
   - Documentation of abs_delta column addition
   - Practical usage examples

## Why Archived?

These files were created during active development and investigation. Their content has been:
- Reviewed and validated
